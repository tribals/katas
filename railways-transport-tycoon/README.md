# Kata

Design a database schema for the tickets sales system for long-distance trains.

## Note

Of course, designing such a real system would take a lot of time and would go far beyond the scope of the question. Therefore, guided by common sense, you will need to choose your limitations - what you include in the system and what you don't.

## Evaluate

I preffer to manage my stuff using Guix, see: [Installation](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Installation.html#Installation).

When you're done, run:

```console
$ guix shell --container
[env]$ ./kata.sh
```
